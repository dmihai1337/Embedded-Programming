Describe how you organized the work within the group on the way to the 
submission, i.e.,~summarize how you partitioned the work, which group 
member was (mainly) responsible for which subtask(s), how you organized 
testing and integration, how well your time plan worked, which 
re-adjustments needed to be done, and how well your collaboration 
worked.

	We split up level two: Simon Boehm: Ctrl, Mihai-Andrei Dancu: Forwarding.
We tested our implementations using the provided code listings and a combination of
modified given tests to ensure that problems are found and fixed before the design 
is compiled.
